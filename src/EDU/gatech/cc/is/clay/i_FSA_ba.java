 * A Finite State Automoton that generates an integer output.
 * While in the current state, if trigger[current_state][edge].Value()
 * is true, the new state is follow_on[current_state][edge].
 * You must fill in the values of these arrays yourself.  It is
 * best to look at an example.

 * This node may be used to implement "Temporal Sequencing" as
 * developed in the Mobile Robot Lab at Georgia Tech.
